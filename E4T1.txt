# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.
- Update the instance security group by allowing only connection from the ALB security group.
   As the port 22 is not accessible nor forwarded from the ALB it should harden the security on the instance
- Allow access to the instance through the session manager if that is really needed.
   Create an IAM Role Policy allowing access to the EC2 instances thought AWS Session Manager.
   This way access to the port 22 from the internet would be closed
- Remove the instance from the public instance and put it behind a NAT in the private subnet.
   Thus no more visible from the internet

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.
To prevent the access we can make a use of the Customer-Managed CMK for the recipe encryption linked to a specific IAM Role policy.
This role could then be given the the admin or anyone allow to access to the secret recipe.
We could also make sure that any Policy given concerning the Amazon S3 service specifies the exact bucket the user/app should access (least privilege rule)
