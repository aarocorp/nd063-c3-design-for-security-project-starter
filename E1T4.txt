Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
WebAppSG is not well configure.
This security group allow ingress traffic from the internet to the web service instance on ports 22, 80 and 5000 and allow all egress traffic from the server,
even though the application is behind an application load balancer. This expose the instance to any attack from the internet

# Poor practice 2
The buckets, free and secret, are both available through the net.
There is nor policies, nor VPC endpoints, nor any type of encryption to restrict the entities which can access this resources and prevent those data to be readable.
Also in the event of privileged business user credentials leak/lost, the attacker can easily access to the secret recipe vault and retrieve anything store within

# Poor practice 3
Usage of an insecure protocol to access to the web instance server (Port 80 instead of port 443).
All the data exchanged between a user and the server can be easily read by a middleman.

# Poor practice 4
Web instance server in the public subnet despite the presence of an application load balancer. This increase the exposure of the instance through the internet
