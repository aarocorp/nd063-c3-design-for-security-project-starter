Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
Hereafter the vulnerabilities related to the code we just deployed :
- securityhub-s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled-8793e307 (server side encryption) :
   Resources s3 buckets for free and secret recipes and for buckets used to log the VPC flow and the configs snapshots
- securityhub-s3-bucket-logging-enabled-0daf7881 (logging activation on Buckets) :
   Resources s3 buckets for free and secret recipes and for buckets used to log the VPC flow and the configs snapshots
- securityhub-ec2-instance-managed-by-ssm-34e64f77 (EC2 not manager by AWS Systems Manager) :
   EC2 instances created
- securityhub-encrypted-volumes-1e88a6c6 (No encrypted volumes on EC2 instances) :
   EC2 instances created
- securityhub-restricted-ssh-9a9ce04c (incoming ssh allowed on the EC2 instances) :
   EC2 instances created
- securityhub-alb-http-to-https-redirection-check-9f8cd4e9 (HTTP redirection to HTTP lacking) :
   Application Load Balancer

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
Hereafter are the recommendations on how to remediate:
- Move the web service instance into the private subnet and add a NAT Gateway to ease the communication between Public Subnet #1 and private Subnet #1
- Update the WebAppSG security group by allowing only access to port 5000 by the security group AppLoadBalancer (implicit all other access to Web Service instance must be removed)
- Create VPC endpoints out of the S3 Buckets to restrict the access to only components of the vpc through a specific security group or to IAM Role
- Create a IAM Role Policy allowing access to the EC2 instances thought AWS Session Manager
- Enable Server Side encryption on both EC2 ELB storages and S3 Buckets
- Enable Customer-Managed CMK for application side encryption
